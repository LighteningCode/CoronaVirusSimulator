# CoronaVirusSimulator

Wrote this program with a friend. 
What it does is you run a data file through it that contains the persons `<name> <age> <infeaction of COVID probablity>`
Then you have another file (connections.dat) which simulates connections relations 1 to 1 people meeting each other.

After, you run the app and use the command line to see what happens over time.
